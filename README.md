# TrafficModel

## How to run?

#### Step 1: Process Image
    1. At first we must read the image and make csv based on the road and traffic intensity.
    2. We cannot read 30 days data and store it in a single file.
    3. We need to make multiple csv file. 
    4. We can do it using process_data.py file.
    5. I made the csv for all the 30 days data and saved in 6 csv files
    6. You will find the csv files in the following links: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SYYDbFC28o30gmAleKq9uMeBvl2yQL0x
